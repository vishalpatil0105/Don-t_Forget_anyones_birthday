# Don-t_Forget_anyones_birthday
This application allows to send email/sms on their birthday 
in this application i used smtplib module 
pandas to read csv

how this project works
u have to store all birthdates and email address and name of your friends and family members 
then this application will seach dirthdaate and current date in csv file data if that data matches then it will take 
one of letter templates and replace the name with persons name and send the birthday wish to him or her


For this to work please read smtplib gmail documentation
we have to do some changes in our email id in order to send email 

for this to work 24*7 please upload this files on python every where or some other flatform so that it will execute our program automatically ...

and please provid your email and pass.

thank u..
